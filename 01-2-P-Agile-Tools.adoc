=== Project Management Tools for Agile Development

==== GitHub Projects

First, we create a new repository under everyone's own account to demonstrate the basic features of "GitHub Projects".

. Visit https://github.com/ then click on _New repository_ (green buttom on the right).

. Set your user as the owner of the repository.

. Give a name for the repository (e.g., ecse321-tutorial-1), leave it _public_, then check _Initialize this repository with a README_. Click on _Create repository_ afterwards. At this point the remote repository is ready to use. +

Once the repository is ready, associate a new GitHub Project and see how their features work. Create a project: +

===== Tasks to complete:

. Create a few issues to outline the tasks for the first deliverable. Assign them appropriate labels and add yourself as the assignee! +

. Create a milestone for the issues. +

. Create cards from the issues on the project board.

. See how GitHub track the project progress as you move the cards from the different columns.

==== ZenHub

ZenHub is an addition to GitHub that is designed to provide features helpful for agile development processes. It basically extends and replaces classic GitHub Projects. 

. Log in with your GitHub account on https://www.zenhub.com/

. Open the repository at https://github.com/McGill-ECSE321-Winter2019/ZenHub-Example

. Create a new epic about "Desinging REST API for backend <McGill ID>" and add your McGill ID to make the epic's name unique

. See how your epic is automatically created as an issue and added to the GitHub issue tracker! What else does ZenHub take care of?

. Optional: add the Firefox/Chrome ZenHub extension to your browser to allow full integration of ZenHub to the GitHub web UI
