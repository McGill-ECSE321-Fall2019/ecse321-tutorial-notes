=== Gradle: A Build Framework

==== Example Gradle application

This section focuses on writing a Gradle (https://gradle.org/) build script that builds a single Gradle project referred to as _computation_. The project with the below gradle structure is available for you to download and import in your IDE.

. Go to this link:https://mcgill-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/rijul_saini_mail_mcgill_ca/ERTyFtLW8VVEjTmv9VXipGwBlv0rj7TRMAfHKKH5ZicJdg?e=hej1a8[link] and download the _computation.zip_. Once it is downloaded, extract the project from zip. 

. Open your IDE and import the extracted project(from step 1) as _Existing Gradle Project_.

. After improting the project, check that your imorted project has the required structure as shown below:

+
[source,none]
----
computation
├── build.gradle
└── src
    ├── main
    │   └── java
    │       ├── application
    │       │   └── CompApp.java
    │       ├── computation
    │       │   └── Computation.java
    │       └── view
    │           └── ComputationPage.java
    └── test
        └── java
            └── computation
                ├── AllTests.java
                ├── ComputationTestAddSubstract.java
                └── ComputationTestDivideMultiply.java
----

. Open the _build.gradle_ file and check for the relevant parts as discussed in the steps (5 to 9) below.

. `java` and the `application` plugins are added in the build configuration script _build.gradle_. 
+
[source,gradle]
----
apply plugin: 'java'
// This plugin has a predefined 'run' task that we can reuse to use Gradle to execute our application
apply plugin: 'application'
----
. JUnit libraries are added in the `dependencies` section.
+
[source,gradle]
----
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
dependencies {
    testImplementation "junit:junit:4.12"
}
----
. A task `compile(type: JavaCompile)` has been added to specify all source files (both application and test) and set the _build/bin_ as destination dir to put all compiled class files in.
+
[source,gradle]
----
task compile(type: JavaCompile) {
  classpath = sourceSets.main.compileClasspath
  classpath += sourceSets.test.runtimeClasspath
  sourceSets.test.java.outputDir = file('build/bin')
  sourceSets.main.java.outputDir = file('build/bin')
}
----
+
[NOTE]
One can specify source sets and their variables the following way:
+
[source,gradle]
----
/*
 * specifying sourceSets is not necessary in this case, since
 * we are applying the default folder structure assumed by Gradle
 */
sourceSets {
  main {
    java { srcDir 'src/main/java' }
  }
  test {
    java { srcDir 'src/test/java'}
  }
}
----

. The main class has been specified as shown below. Now, you can proceed and run the application.
+
[source,gradle]
----
mainClassName='application.CompApp'
----
+
In the command line issue `gradle run`

. The `jar` Gradle task (defined by the `java` plugin) has been added to produce an executable jar file into `distributable/`.
+
[source,gradle]
----
jar {
  destinationDir=file('distributable')
  manifest { 
    // It is smart to reuse the name of the main class variable instead of hardcoding it
    attributes "Main-Class": "$mainClassName"
  }  
}
----

[NOTE]
The `settings.gradle` and its usage is to be shown later.
